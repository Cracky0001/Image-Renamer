# ImageRenamer - The Ultimate Image Renaming Tool

## What's This About, Homie?

Wanna rename your images and take a wild trip to the future? ImageRenamer is your go-to, buddy! This badass tool scans your folder, grabs all images, and renames them with random numbers and letters. But wait, thereâ€™s more: We're sending your images straight to the future - precisely to February 22, 2077, at 22:22 UTC.

## Let's Roll, Fam!

### Requirements

Make sure you've got .NET on your machine. No .NET, no party.

### Installation

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Cracky0001/Image-Renamer/releases)` and download the latest `.exe`.
2. Find where you saved it and double-click to start the magic.

### Usage

1. Run the program.
2. If there are no images in the current directory, the tool will ask for another path.
3. Hit "y" (for yes) or "n" (for no), depending on what you wanna do.
4. If you choose "y", enter the path where your images are chillin'.
5. The tool will show you all the images it's gonna rename.
6. Ready to roll? Hit "y" again.
7. Sit back and watch your images time-travel to the future.

## Safety Ain't No Joke, Bro!

Chill, before anything gets renamed, the tool creates a backup of your images. Find them in the "ImageRenamerBackup" folder in your pictures.

## A Word of Caution, Homie!
